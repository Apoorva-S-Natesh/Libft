My implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions including some additional ones.

What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.
The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so I can later use that library from other projects at 42.

Compile
      1. run make or make libft to compile libft.a 
      2. run make clean to delete tmp files after compile (only libft.a will be remain)
      3. run make fclean to delete all files after compile
      4. run make re to recompile all files
